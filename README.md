# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) Crypto application - EPC4

This code example demonstrates cryptography using Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) on PSOC&trade; Edge MCU. The example demonstrates how to initialize the TF-M NS interface in CM33 NS and CM55 NS projects and use the crypto services offered by TF-M with PSA APIs. The code example is designed to work on Edge Protect Category 4 (EPC4) MCU. For more information about Edge Protect Category see [here](https://www.infineon.com/promo/edge-protect).

This Code Example has a three project structure - CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 project.

**proj_cm33_s**: TF-M is available as source code in mtb_shared directory. The proj_cm33_s is completely built out of this TF-M library. Only Makefile and dependencies are present in this project directory that makes use of TF-M library. The TF-M application is programmed in External Flash and loaded to SRAM for execution.

**proj_cm33_ns**: This is the M33 NSPE project which contains the TF-M interface and calls the PSA APIs to use TF-M services. The CM33 NS application is executed from External Flash and does not use RTOS.

**proj_cm55**: This is the M55 NSPE project. This project also has TF-M interface but does not call PSA APIs. Include the required PSA interface header files and the project is ready to use PSA APIs. The CM55 project is executed from External Flash and does not use RTOS.

See the [Design and implementation](docs/design_and_implementation.md) for the functional description of this code example.


## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade;](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) v3.6 or later (tested with v3.6)
- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version for:
   - KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC4: v1.0.0
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: All [PSOC&trade; Edge EPC4 MCU](https://www.infineon.com/products/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex/32-bit-psoc-edge-arm) parts


## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v14.2.1 (`GCC_ARM`) – Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm&reg; Compiler v6.22 (`ARM`)
- IAR C/C++ Compiler v9.50.2 (`IAR`)


## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_EVAL) (`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC4`) – Default value of `TARGET`

## Hardware setup

This example DOES NOT use the board's default configuration.

Ensure the following jumper and pin configuration on board.
- BOOT SW must be in the LOW/OFF position
- J20 and J21 must be in the tristate/not connected (NC) position


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Operation

### Add the Edge Protect Bootloader

1. Add **proj_bootloader** to this code example as a first step. Follow the steps #2 to #9 in the **Operation** section of the [Edge Protect Bootloader](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-edge-protect-bootloader) code example's *README.md* file
  
   > **Note:** [Edge Protect Bootloader](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-edge-protect-bootloader) *README.md* describes how to add the bootloader to **Basic Secure App**. Add it to **this** code example instead.

### Program the application

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

> **Note**: Windows has 260 character path length limit so for TF-M application to build successfully, ensure that <WorkspacePath>\<Application Name> (including back slash) path is less than or equal to 32 characters.

2. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

4. Program the board with TF-M application. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "PSOC Edge MCU: Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) Crypto Application" is displayed on the UART terminal
